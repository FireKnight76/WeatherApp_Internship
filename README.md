# WeatherApp_Internship

In the process of making this REST api that can translate the data from a weather api and show it on a website, I made some mistakes.

I was excited to start learning a new framework and working on something I have never done before and in my excitement I accidentally showed all the cities and their selected weather data.

I managed to change it back to the desired result the next day but it was still a bummer that I spent a bunch of time going down the wrong road. However it was a valuable experience and still kind of fun to figure that stuff out, even if it wasn't necessary.

I followed the basic structure I have been learning on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/django/index.php) since that seemed to work. I decided to focus on the functionality instead of the exterior of the website and tried to stick to the coding conventions as much as I could.

It is still kind of messy since I have not done any real project for a while, only research due to some subjects that did not require any coding. I especially have not done anything with html for about 2 years now which I could definitely notice.

For the technical side I decided to save the cities in a list that drops down in favor of space and to make the website look a bit neater. I also saved them in a list since that seemed like a simple solution for viewing and finding the desired city. From there the software can request the provided name to input it into the api url to request the data.

The date was a bit trickier, but I made it work by using if statements. This statement checks if the user selected a specific date and if they did the software will pick the url necessary for viewing the historical data.

I originally wanted to place the Weather status in the middle of the page but did not manage to because I spent all my time fixing my mistakes.
